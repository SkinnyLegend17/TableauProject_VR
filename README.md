# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The purpose of this project is to combine and utilize various features/tools using Tableau. In this project, I will be analyzing data from AirBNB, and the listings across various NYC neighborhoods using Tableau to create different visualizations and dashboards for demonstration and analysis. My goal for this project is to be comfortable with navigating Tableau and utilizing different features/tools to create interactive, clear visualizations. 


## Process
Step 1: Download AirBNB dataset and connect it to Tableau 
Step 2: Analyze and detect the different data types in dataset
Step 3: Create 5 different visualizations using different columns and compare
Step 4: Analyze different categories (Neighborhood, room type, etc.) and identify any trends within data
Step 5: Create Dashboard displaying results 

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

For this project, I had chosen the AirBNB dataset (Option 2) to do my analysis. The main data question that I identified was What is the average price in each neighborhood? And are there significant variations?. In identifying this question, I first created a visualization that demonstrated the average listing price, the year a host has been active since, and the neighborhood in NYC.

With this visualization, I detected that Manhattan had the highest average listing price across the 5 different neighborhoods, and the overall listing price across all neighborhoods was approximately $550,000. Another notable pattern that I identified was that over the 8 years (from 2009 to 2015), the listing prices have increased each year, demonstrating a positive trend in the data. 


## Challenges 
Some challenges that I faced in this project was creating meaningful visualizations/ dashboard that were clear, visable, and answered the key question within the dataset. 

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would try to play around with the data more to create additional visualizations using the dataset, and create a story on Tableau. In addition to the above, I would explore more of different features/tools that Tableau offers, such as the Objects feature, layouts, etc.
